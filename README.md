# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹  
This is an Expo project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://github.com/expo/create-expo-app).

---

## Get started

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install


npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

development build

Android emulator

iOS simulator

Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

When you're ready, run:


npm run reset-project

This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory
and create a blank app directory where you can start developing.
